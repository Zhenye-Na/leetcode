# Testcase Example:  '[1,3,5,4,7]'
#
# Given an integer arrayÂ nums, return the number of longest increasing
# subsequences.
# 
# Notice that the sequence has to be strictly increasing.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1,
# 3, 5, 7].
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1,
# and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= nums.length <= 2000
# -10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
# 
#
