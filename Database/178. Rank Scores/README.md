# 178. Rank Scores

Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.

```
+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
```

For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):

```
+-------+------+
| Score | Rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+
```

## Algorithm I: `DENSE_RANK()`

The following query shows the difference between

- `RANK()`, which **produces ranks with gaps**
- `DENSE_RANK()`, which **produces ranks without gaps**

The query shows rank values for each member of a set of values in the val column, which contains some duplicates.

- `RANK()` assigns peers (the duplicates) the same rank value, and the next greater value has a rank higher by the number of peers minus one. 
- `DENSE_RANK()` also assigns peers the same rank value, but the next higher value has a rank one greater. 

For reference, the query also displays row numbers using `ROW_NUMBER()`:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
         val,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER w AS 'row_number',
         RANK()       OVER w AS 'rank',
         DENSE_RANK() OVER w AS 'dense_rank'
       FROM numbers
       WINDOW w AS (ORDER BY val);
+------+------------+------+------------+
| val  | row_number | rank | dense_rank |
+------+------------+------+------------+
|    1 |          1 |    1 |          1 |
|    1 |          2 |    1 |          1 |
|    2 |          3 |    3 |          2 |
|    3 |          4 |    4 |          3 |
|    3 |          5 |    4 |          3 |
|    3 |          6 |    4 |          3 |
|    4 |          7 |    7 |          4 |
|    4 |          8 |    7 |          4 |
|    5 |          9 |    9 |          5 |
+------+------------+------+------------+
```
