#
# You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented
# as:
# 
# 
# L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
# 
# 
# Reorder the list to be on the following form:
# 
# 
# L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
# 
# 
# You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may
# be changed.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [1,4,2,3]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 10^4].
# 1 <= Node.val <= 1000
# 
#
