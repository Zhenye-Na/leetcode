# Testcase Example:  '[[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]]'
#
# You have an undirected, connected graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1.
# You are given an array graph where graph[i] is a list of all the nodes
# connected with node i by an edge.
# 
# Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node. You may start
# and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse
# edges.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: One possible path is [1,0,2,0,3]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: graph = [[1],[0,2,4],[1,3,4],[2],[1,2]]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: One possible path is [0,1,4,2,3]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# n == graph.length
# 1 <= n <= 12
# 0 <= graph[i].length <Â n
# graph[i] does not contain i.
# If graph[a] contains b, then graph[b] contains a.
# The input graph is always connected.
