# Testcase Example:  '"leetscode"\n["leet","code","leetcode"]'
#
# You are given a 0-indexed string s and a dictionary of words dictionary. You
# have to break s into one or more non-overlapping substrings such that each
# substring is present in dictionary. There may be some extra characters in s
# which are not present in any of the substrings.
# 
# Return the minimum number of extra characters left over if you break up s
# optimally.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "leetscode", dictionary = ["leet","code","leetcode"]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: "leet" from index 0 to 3 and
# "code" from index 5 to 8. There is only 1 unused character (at index 4), so
# we return 1.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "sayhelloworld", dictionary = ["hello","world"]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: "hello" from index 3 to 7 and
# "world" from index 8 to 12. The characters at indices 0, 1, 2 are not used in
# any substring and thus are considered as extra characters. Hence, we return
# 3.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= s.length <= 50
# 1 <= dictionary.length <= 50
# 1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 50
# dictionary[i]Â and s consists of only lowercase English letters
# dictionary contains distinct words
# 
#

class Solution:
    def minExtraChar(self, s: str, dictionary: List[str]) -> int:

        dictionary = set(dictionary)
        s = "#" + s
        dp = [len(s) for _ in range(len(s))]
        dp[0] = 0

        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            for j in range(0, i):

                if s[j + 1: i + 1] in dictionary:
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j])
                else:
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + i - j)

        return dp[-1]
