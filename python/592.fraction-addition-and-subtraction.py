#
# Given a string expression representing an expression of fraction addition and
# subtraction, return the calculation result in string format.
#
# The final result should be an irreducible fraction. If your final result is
# an integer, change it to the format of a fraction that has a denominator 1.
# So in this case, 2 should be converted to 2/1.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: expression = "-1/2+1/2"
# Output: "0/1"
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: expression = "-1/2+1/2+1/3"
# Output: "1/3"
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: expression = "1/3-1/2"
# Output: "-1/6"
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The input string only contains '0' to '9', '/', '+' and '-'. So does the
# output.
# Each fraction (input and output) has the format Â±numerator/denominator. If
# the first input fraction or the output is positive, then '+' will be
# omitted.
# The input only contains valid irreducible fractions, where the numerator and
# denominator of each fraction will always be in the range [1, 10]. If the
# denominator is 1, it means this fraction is actually an integer in a fraction
# format defined above.
# The number of given fractions will be in the range [1, 10].
# The numerator and denominator of the final result are guaranteed to be valid
# and in the range of 32-bit int.

class Solution:
    def fractionAddition(self, expression: str) -> str:
        expression = expression.replace("-", "+-")
        fractions = expression.split("+")

        result = Fraction(0, 1)

        for frac in fractions:
            if frac:
                result += Fraction(frac)

        return f"{result.numerator}/{result.denominator}"
