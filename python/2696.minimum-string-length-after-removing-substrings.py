# Testcase Example:  '"ABFCACDB"'
#
# You are given a string s consisting only of uppercase English letters.
#
# You can apply some operations to this string where, in one operation, you can
# remove any occurrence of one of the substrings "AB" or "CD" from s.
#
# Return the minimum possible length of the resulting string that you can
# obtain.
#
# Note that the string concatenates after removing the substring and could
# produce new "AB" or "CD" substrings.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: s = "ABFCACDB"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: We can do the following operations:
# - Remove the substring "ABFCACDB", so s = "FCACDB".
# - Remove the substring "FCACDB", so s = "FCAB".
# - Remove the substring "FCAB", so s = "FC".
# So the resulting length of the string is 2.
# It can be shown that it is the minimum length that we can obtain.
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: s = "ACBBD"
# Output: 5
# Explanation: We cannot do any operations on the string so the length remains
# the same.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= s.length <= 100
# sÂ consists only of uppercase English letters.

class Solution:
    def minLength(self, s: str) -> int:
        if not s or len(s) <= 0:
            return 0

        if len(s) < 2:
            return len(s)

        res = []
        for char in s:
            if not res:
                res.append(char)
            else:
                if char == "B" and res[-1] == "A":
                    res.pop()
                elif char == "D" and res[-1] == "C":
                    res.pop()
                else:
                    res.append(char)

        return len(res)
