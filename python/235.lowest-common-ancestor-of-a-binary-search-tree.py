#
# Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of
# two given nodes in the BST.
# 
# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor
# is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p
# and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of
# itself).”
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant
# of itself according to the LCA definition.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
# Output: 2
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10^5].
# -10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
# All Node.val are unique.
# p != q
# p and q will exist in the BST.
# 
# 
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        if not root or not p or not q:
            return None

        return self._findLCA(root, p, q)


    def _findLCA(self, root, p, q):
        if root == p or root == q:
            return root

        if root.val < p.val and root.val < q.val:
            return self._findLCA(root.right, p, q)
        elif root.val > p.val and root.val > q.val:
            return self._findLCA(root.left, p, q)
        else:
            return root
