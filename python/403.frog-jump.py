#
# A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units,
# and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a
# stone, but it must not jump into the water.
# 
# Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order,
# determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone.
# Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be
# 1 unit.
# 
# If the frog's last jump was k units, its next jump must be either k - 1, k,
# or k + 1 units. The frog can only jump in the forward direction.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
# Output: true
# Explanation: The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the 2nd
# stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3
# units to the 6th stone, 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th
# stone.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: stones = [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
# Output: false
# Explanation: There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between the
# 5th and 6th stone is too large.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 2 <= stones.length <= 2000
# 0 <= stones[i] <= 2^31 - 1
# stones[0] == 0
# stonesÂ is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
#
