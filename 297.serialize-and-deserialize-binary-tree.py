# Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a
# sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or
# transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the
# same or another computer environment.
# 
# Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no
# restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work.
# You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and
# this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
# 
# Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes
# a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please
# be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
# Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = []
# Output: []
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1]
# Output: [1]
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2]
# Output: [1,2]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
# -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
# 
# 
#

# Definition for a binary tree node.

#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
