 *
 * Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If
 * there is no cycle, return null.
 * 
 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can
 * be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos
 * is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is
 * connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is
 * not passed as a parameter.
 * 
 * Do not modify the linked list.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
 * Output: tail connects to node index 1
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the
 * second node.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
 * Output: tail connects to node index 0
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the
 * first node.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [1], pos = -1
 * Output: no cycle
 * Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4].
 * -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
 * pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?
