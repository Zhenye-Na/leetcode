#
# A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random
# pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.
# 
# Return a deep copy of the list.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input:
# 
# {"$id":"1","next":{"$id":"2","next":null,"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":2},"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":1}
# 
# Explanation:
# Node 1's value is 1, both of its next and random pointer points to Node 2.
# Node 2's value is 2, its next pointer points to null and its random pointer
# points to itself.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# You must return the copy of the given headÂ as a reference to the cloned
# list.
