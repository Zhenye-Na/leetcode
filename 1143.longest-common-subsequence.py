# Testcase Example:  '"abcde"\n"ace"'
#
# Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common
# subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
# 
# A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string
# with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative
# order of the remaining characters.
# 
# 
# For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
# 
# 
# A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both
# strings.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
# Output: 3  
# Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
# text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.
#

    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:

        # insert a dummy character to make sure
        # index not out of range
        text1 = "#" + text1
        text2 = "#" + text2
        f = [[0 for _ in range(l2 + 1)] for _ in range(l1 + 1)]

        for i in range(1, l1 + 1):
            for j in range(1, l2 + 1):
                if text1[i] == text2[j]:
                    f[i][j] = f[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                else:
                    f[i][j] = max(
                        f[i - 1][j - 1],
                        f[i][j - 1],
                        f[i - 1][j]
                    )
